# WorkDay-Scheduler

## **Description**

I created a simple workday scheduler to enable a user to record their daily activity/schedule.

The desired outcome was to allow for the following to happen::

-Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
-Show timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
-Each timeblock would be become color-coded according to whether an event was in past, present, or future when the timeblock is viewed.
-Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock
-Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock
-Persist events between refreshes of a page

Languages ued to create the applictaion were:
-HTML
-CSS
-Vanilla JavaScript
-JQuery, incorporating day.js

The application runs within the window and is initiated when the user clicks the 'Generate Password' button.


## **Usage**

N/A

## **Credits**

The following resources were used to research the coding funcionality for the successful deployment of the application: YouTube, w3schools, and MDN.

I did not use a tutor guidance session for this challenge.
