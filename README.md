# WorkDay-Scheduler

## **Description**

I created a simple workday scheduler to enable a user to record their daily activity/schedule.

The desired outcome was to allow for the following to happen::

-Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner in the browser;  
-Show timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down;  
-Each timeblock would become color-coded according to whether an event was in the past, present, or future when the timeblock is viewed;  
-Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock;  
-Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock;  
-Persist events between refreshes of a page  

Languages ued to create the applictaion were:  
-HTML  
-CSS  
-Vanilla JavaScript  
-JQuery, incorporating day.js  

The deployed page can be found here: https://nadiafortune.github.io/WorkDay-Scheduler/

## **Installation**

The application runs within the browser and events are saved when the user types into the timeblocks.


## **Usage**

As above

## **Credits**

The following resources were used to research the coding funcionality for the successful deployment of the application: YouTube, w3schools, MDN, JQuery CDN, and day.js

I did not use a tutor guidance session for this challenge.
